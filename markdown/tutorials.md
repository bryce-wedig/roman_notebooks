# Roman Cloud Science Tutorials

Roman mission data will be useful and interesting to many group and workflows. Here we outline the cotents of each notebook, and suggest the most likely users to benefit from that lesson.

## "Typical" Users

The most common users we expect to have are
1. Instrument Scientists, who are interested in simulating the performance of the instruments and running the calibration pipelines.
2. Proposers, who want to estimate the necessary conditions for observing a target.
3. Data analysts, which covers a wide range of astronomers and cosmologists that want to use Roman data for science.

There are many potential workflows that we haven't covered in this outline; even if you don't see it here, RSP can likely support your workflow!

| [Running Romancal and Romanisim](../content/notebooks/romanisim_romancal/romanisim_romancal.ipynb)              | Generate level 1 and level 2 WFI images using romanism, and run the exposure-level pipeline on these images.                                                                                                        | Instrument Scientists |
