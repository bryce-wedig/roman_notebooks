# Getting Started with Jupyter

## The Basics: How do I use the interface?
The [try Jupyter](https://try.jupyter.org) site is a great place to begin; select the "JupyterLab" option, then start the "Welcome Tour". This interactive tour will give you a thorough walkthrough of the JupyterLab user interface. Once that tour is complete, you should open a new, blank notebook and begin the "Notebook Tour"; it explains how to write and run code in a notebook environment.

## Changing to a Different Server
To switch to a different server type (e.g. one with more CPU cores, or with different team access), you first need to shutdown your existing server. To do this, select <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">file â€º hub control panel</span> from the menu bar and then click the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">stop my server</span> button. Then, you can click the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">start my server</span> button to launch a server of your choice.


## A Detailed Description: How does this work?
Users curious about how Jupyter works (and the history and motivation for a computational notebook) should start by reading the ["What is Jupyter?"](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) page.
