# RSP Science Workflows: WFI Observations Planning
This workflow is designed for users aiming to plan their surveys and observations by considering a number of design elements.
![wfi-obs-flowchart](../../images/wfi-obs-planning.png)

## Workflow description
- [Quick Characterization of Roman WFI Exposure Capabilities](../../content/notebooks/rist/rist.ipynb)
> Get a quick idea of your exposure parameters using RIST (the Roman Imager Simulation Tool). Use RIST to get an initial understanding of the expected SNR for a point source with a flat spectrum and given magnitude as a function of filter and exposure time.
- [Define the Exposure Parameters of Your WFI Observation](../../content/notebooks/pandeia/pandeia.ipynb)
> Refine your exposure parameters with Pandeia, the official exposure time calculator for the Roman Space Telescope. Simulate multiple representative sources with given characteristics (e.g., SED, extension) over a small area of a representative WFI detector and optimize your observing parameters to reach the needed SNR.
- [Simulate a Full FOV Observation with WFI](../../content/notebooks/stips/stips.ipynb)
> Create realistic simulations of your observations using STIPS (the Space Telescope Imaging Product Simulator). STIPS outputs are within 10% agreement of Pandeia simulations and use point spread functions (PSFs) generated with WebbPSF. Use STIPS to simulate a complete observation with the WFI using the observing parameters derived with Pandeia. Create a realistic astronomical scene, generate input catalogs, consider multiple pointings, and understand the effect of noise residuals.
- Detailed Characterization of WFIâ€™s PSFs and Throughput Curves
    - > Understand the WFI performance using WebbPSF, a Python package that [simulates PSFs for the Roman Space Telescope](../../content/notebooks/webbpsf/webbpsf.ipynb) (as well as the James Webb Space Telescope). 	
    - > Use the synthetic photometry software, synphot, to [estimate the brightness of both empirical and model sources](../../content/notebooks/synphot/synphot.ipynb) as they would be measured by the WFI.
