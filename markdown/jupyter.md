# Getting Started with Jupyter

## The Basics: How do I use the interface?
The [try Jupyter](https://try.jupyter.org) site is a great place to begin; start by selecting the "JupyterLab" option, then start the "Welcome Tour". This interactive tour will give you a thorough walkthrough of the user interface. Once that tour is complete, you should open a new, blank notebook and begin the notebook tour.

## A Detailed Description: How does this work?
Users curious about how Jupyter works (and the history and motivation for a computational notebook) should start by reading the ["What is Jupyter?"](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) page.
