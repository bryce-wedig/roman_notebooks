# Getting Started with Jupyter

## The Basics: How do I use the interface?
If you are new to Jupyter, we encourage you to take the **"Welcome Tour"**. This interactive tour provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the JupyterLab user interface. You can access the tour when prompted during your first login or later through the **help** menu. 

To learn more about Jupyter notebooks, start by opening a new blank notebook. In the main work area, open a new tab and select **"Notebook"** under any available kernel. You are now ready to begin the "Notebook Tour", which explains how to writ and run code in the notebook environment.

For more information on the Jupyter interface, please see the ["Project Jupyter Documentation"](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) page.

## Changing to a Different Server
To switch to a different server type (e.g. one with more CPU cores, or with different team access), you first need to shutdown your existing server. To do this, select <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">file â€º hub control panel</span> from the menu bar and then click the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">stop my server</span> button. Then, you can click the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">start my server</span> button to launch a server of your choice.

Note: To conserve computational resources, please remember to shut down your server when you have finished your work.

## A Detailed Description: How does this work?
Users curious about how Jupyter works, as well as the history and motivation behind computational notebooks, should start by reading the ["What is Jupyter?"](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) page.
