    "## Introduction\n",
    "The ``RIST`` is a simulation tool designed to help users quickly explore the feasibility of observations for the Wide Field Instrument (WFI). The ``RIST`` is a simplified version of [``Pandeia``](https://www.stsci.edu/roman/science-planning-toolbox/pandeia)(the Exposure Time Calculator) -- it uses a pre-computed grid of ``Pandeia`` that samples a set of exposure parameters and observing setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``RIST`` provides users an estimate of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on their selections of source brightness, background and level, multi-accumulation (MA) tables, and number of resultants, while using a single on-axis point source in the detector with a flat spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "The ``RIST`` depends on a number of modules to run. A comprehensive list of these modules and how they are utilized are listed below:\n",
    "- *NumPy* for numerical computing\n",
    "- *pandas* to read and load the pre-computed *pandeia* grid\n",
    "- *bokeh* for the interactive plotting\n",
    "- *xarray* to provide RIST an N-dimentional array as a structure of the pre-computed *pandeia* grid\n",
    "- *SciPy* to interpolate RIST's *xarray* grid.\n",
    "- *Pandeia* is the Exposure Time Calculator for Roman and is used to compute a grid that samples a set of parameter space. *Pandeia* uses the following modules:\n",
    "  - *astropy* \n",
    "  - *photutils==1.7.0*\n",
    "  - *synphot==1.2.0*\n",
    "  - *stsynphot==1.2.0*\n",
    "  - *six==1.16.0*\n",
    "  - *setuptools==67.7.0*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import \n",
    "The ``RIST`` is designed to work within a Jupyter notebook cell with an import of the ``plot_rist`` module.\n",
    "Execute the cell below to start using the ``RIST``.\n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "- ``RIST`` assumes a flat spectrum point source target. For extended sources or targets with different spectral shapes, please use ``Pandeia`` for more accurate results.\n",
    "- The source magnitude is in ABmag.\n",
    "- For the backgrounds, they were calculated using the [JWST Backgrounds Tool](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-other-tools/jwst-backgrounds-tool#gsc.tab=0). \n",
    "    - The \"ecliptic\" background option refers to a background along the ecliptic at ecliptic coordinates Lon = 90° &  Lat = 0°. \n",
    "    - The \"minzodi\" background option refers to a background at RA = 17:26:49 & Dec = -73:20:03 (J2000). At this location, the zodiacal emission is 20% higher than the celestial minimum.\n",
    "    - The \"benchmark\" refers to the background at the minzodi location on June 19, 2020. \n",
    "    - The low, medium, and high refer to the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile, respectively, of the average background at the specified position over the period of visibility.\n",
    "- For the MA tables, these are what the acronyms stand for:\n",
    "    - HLWAS: High Latitude Wide Area Survey\n",
    "    - HLTDS: High Latitude Time Domain Survey\n",
    "    - GBTDS: Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey\n",
    "- Computed SNR values can be seen by hovering the mouse over the points in the plot.\n",
    "- ``Pandeia`` cannot calculate SNR for saturated sources and hence the ``RIST`` -- the saturated points are set to zero and marked with triangles in the plot.\n",
    "- The x-axis shows the central wavelength of each Roman filter.\n",
    "- Once you are satisfied with the estimated SNRs, you should use [Roman ETC](link_here) to provide specific observing parameters for [Roman APT](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/raug). \n",

    "## Caveats\n",
    "- Any limitations that ``Pandeia`` bears are also interited by the ``RIST``. Please see [RDox for Pandeia](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/simulation-tools-handbook-home/pandeia-for-roman/caveats-for-using-pandeia-for-roman) for the details on caveats for using ``Pandeia`` for Roman.\n",
    "- The current version does not handle the following features and the users need to use ``Pandeia`` for:\n",
    "    - Different types of target spectrum -- all SNR computations are performed for a flat spectrum point source. \n",
    "    - The spectroscopic observing mode -- future versions of ``RIST`` will support the spectrocopic mode. "
