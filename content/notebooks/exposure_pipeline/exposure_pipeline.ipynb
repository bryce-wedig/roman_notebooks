    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to calibrate Level 1 (L1; uncalibrated ramp cube) data with the Roman WFI science calibration pipeline RomanCal (Python package name `romancal`) to produce Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate image) exposure level data. To learn more, please visit the [RDox pages on the Exposure Level Pipeline](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/roman-stsci-data-pipelines/exposure-level-pipeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the Roman data levels can be found in the RDox article [Data Levels and Products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products). A L1 file contains a single uncalibrated ramp in units of Data Numbers (DN).  L1 files are three-dimensional data cubes, one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates, that are shaped as  arrays with (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). L2 WFI files are calibrated rate images in instrumental units of DN / second.  They are two-dimensional arrays shaped as (4088 image rows, 4088 image columns)."

We can accomplish this by running the individual AssignWcsStep on an L2 ASDF file. If you ran the previous cells, the file should already be saved on disk.
