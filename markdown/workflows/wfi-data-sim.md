# RSP Science Workflows: WFI Data Simulations

This workflow is designed for users who want to simulate the data products associated with their WFI observations.

## Workflow Description

- [Simulate Roman WFI Data Products](../../content/notebooks/romanisim/romanisim.ipynb)
> Create L1 and L2 simulated data products of your field using Roman I-sim, a Galsim-based simulator for WFI imaging data. Roman I-sim uses Galsim to render astronomical scenes, WebbPSF to model the point spread function, and CRDS to access the calibration information needed to produce realistic WFI images. Use Roman I-sim to simulate L1 and L2 data using synthetic catalogs or the GAIA catalog. Roman I-sim generates outputs in the standard Roman ASDF format.
- [Process Roman WFI Raw Data](../../content/notebooks/romancal/romancal.ipynb)
> Process your data in RomanCal, the Roman calibration pipeline. Learn how to use RomanCal to generate L2 data from L1 raw data obtained with Roman I-sim.
- [Explore Roman WFI Data Files](../../content/notebooks/working_with_asdf/working_with_asdf.ipynb)
> Explore your WFI data products by understanding the ASDF format (Advanced Scientific Data Format). Roman WFI data products, including those generated by Roman I-sim, will be saved in ASDF format. Learn how to manage ASDF files, read the metadata, and access the data arrays.
- [Visualize Roman WFI L2 Data Products](../../content/notebooks/data_visualization/data_visualization.ipynb)
> Visualize your L2 data products using Matplotlib and Imviz, a tool for visualization and analysis of 2D astronomical images based on the Jupyter platform with built-in Astropy functionality.

## Caveat and limitations
While the current content primarily focuses on the WFI imaging mode, Jupyter Notebook tutorials and Science Workflows for spectroscopic products will be available by Winter 2024.
